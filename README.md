# WNBA-Big-Data-Analytics-and-Prediction
A machine learning project on Microsoft Azure aiming to predict the best-performing WNBA player for the upcoming quarter.

-	Utilized Azure AI Machine Learning Studio, highlighting top 4 features importance, to predict top-performing players based on their projected total points. The model demonstrated robustness with metrics like RMSE of 0.024, and R^2 score of 1.
-	Applied PySpark to execute batch data processing on Azure Databricks - encompassing data type conversions, outlier detection using IQR and box plots, data integrity validations, zero value, and missing values treatments. 
-	Integrated the preprocessing routine with Azure Blob Storage, streamlining the storage process of the cleaned dataset as a CSV file for further analyses.
